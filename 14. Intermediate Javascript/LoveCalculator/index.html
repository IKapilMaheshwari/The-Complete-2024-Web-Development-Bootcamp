            Welcome to This great invention of Kapil!
        </p>
        <p>
            We all know that a name can tell a lot about a person. Names are not randomly chosen: they all have a
            meaning. Kapil knew this so he made another great invention just for the lonely you!
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes you'd like to know if a relationship with someone could work out. Therefore Kapil will give you
            some information about your potential future relationship. With The Love Calculator you can calculate the
            probability of a successful relationship between two people. The Love Calculator is an <i>affective</i> way
            to get an impression of what the chances are on a relationship between two people.
        </p>
        <p>
            To find out what the chances for you and your dream partner are, just fill in both full names (both first
            and last name) in the two text boxes below, and press Calculate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please enter the two names to find out the love compatibility between them.
