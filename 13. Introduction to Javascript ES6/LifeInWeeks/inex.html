    <h1>Life in Weeks</h1>
    <p>I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.</p>
    <p>In this Coding Exercise, I have created a Webpage that tells us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old.</p>
    <p>It will take your current age as the input </p>
    <label for="age">Your Age</label>
    <input type="number" id="age" name="age">
    <button id="btn">Calculate</button>
    <h2 id="h2id"></h2>
